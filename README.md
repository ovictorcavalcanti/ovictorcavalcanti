### Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

---

If you have reached my profile page, I guess you want to know a bit more about me and my interests. ðŸ¤”

Welp, here's some information you might be looking for:

```javascript
const name = "Victor Cavalcanti";
const bday = "May 10, 1996";
let age = 26;
let currentRole = "Front-End Web Developer";
let mainTechs = ["HTML5", "CSS3", "JS ES6"];
let fluentLanguages = ["pt-BR", "en-US", "es-ES"];
```

At GitHub, I share a lot of cool coding stuff but mostly my projects (they're all Open Source! ðŸ˜„).

If you decide to dig through my repositories, tho, you can find some stuff related to code challenges that I have participated in and to the techs I'm studying - currently **JS ES2022 new features, React, Vue, and Svelte**.

You can find me here, at my [Portfolio]() website or at my [LinkedIn]() and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ovictorcavalcanti/) profile pages.
